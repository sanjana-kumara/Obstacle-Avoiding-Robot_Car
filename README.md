# 🚗 Obstacle Avoiding & Bluetooth Controlled Car  

An **Arduino-based robotic car** with two modes of operation:  
- **Automatic Mode** → Avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.  
- **Manual Mode** → Controlled via a smartphone through Bluetooth.  

This project showcases the integration of **embedded systems, robotics, and IoT** to create a fully functional smart car.

## 📘 Overview  

The **Obstacle Avoiding & Bluetooth Controlled Car** is built using an **Arduino Uno R3**, motor drivers, ultrasonic sensors, and an HC-05 Bluetooth module.  

- In **obstacle avoiding mode**, the car automatically detects objects and adjusts direction to avoid collisions.  
- In **Bluetooth mode**, a smartphone app enables the user to manually control the car’s movement.
